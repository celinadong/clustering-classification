1. Random selection of initial cluster centre points.
Since the initial cluster centres are randomly allocated, the SSE is very
likely to be high. However, at each iteration, where the cluster centres
are recalculated using the mean, the SSE decreases. In general, when using
k-means clustering, minimizing the SSE is the aim.


2. KD-tree k-means clustering
